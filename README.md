# Jump-The-Gun-Demos

**Welcome to the first major public playtest of *Jump the Gun***!

## About *Jump the Gun*
*Jump the Gun* is a 2D platformer where you will use guns to propel yourselves up at angles to perform precise double (maybe triple!) jumps to reach the top of a single very long, difficult, maybe rage-inducing, and adventurous level.

## Playtest Instructions
- If you came from the Discord server, you can just download and unzip the builds and get to playing. 

- If you haven’t been to our Discord server, follow this [***link***](https://discord.gg/wfejkKWuku) to be taken there. There you can chat with the developers and other testers and get the latest updates on the games continued progress.
